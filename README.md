<h1>Learning Ruby the Hard Way</h1>

I'm trying to get better at Ruby before I try and figure out Rails any further, so I am starting from the beginning of Zed A. Shaw's [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](learnrubythehardway.org).

I'll be commiting all my exercises and solutions to Github (going forward, I'll actually try to commit every attempt I make - so what I type when copying him exactly, what I add to complete the study drills, and anything in between). I'd appreciate any feedback.

For what isn't getting committed - I am using the command line for EVERYTHING except actually editing the files.  I'm creating them with <code>touch FILENAME.rb</code> and opening them with <code>sublime FILENAME.rb</code>.  Shaw regularly asks me to use <code>ruby</code> to use ruby in the Terminal, but I don't seem to be able to figure out how to make any output in that, I've just been using <code>irb</code>.

Finally, I'll also be including any throwaway programs I try to write in Ruby until I am confident enough to move on.
