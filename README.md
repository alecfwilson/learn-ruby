<h1>Learning Ruby the Hard Way</h1>

I'm trying to get better at Ruby before I try and figure out Rails any further, so I am starting from the beginning of Zed A. Shaw's [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](learnrubythehardway.org).

I'll be commiting all my exercises and solutions to Github (going forward, I'll actually try to commit every attempt I make - so what I type when copying him exactly, what I add to complete the study drills, and anything in between). I'd appreciate any feedback.

Quick note: To facilitate the lessons, in cases where Zed's line breaks differently than mine, I'll simply be adding a blank line.

For what isn't getting committed - I am using the command line for EVERYTHING except actually editing the files.  I'm creating them with <code>touch FILENAME.rb</code> and opening them with <code>sublime FILENAME.rb</code>.  Shaw regularly asks me to use <code>ruby</code> to use ruby in the Terminal, but I don't seem to be able to figure out how to make any output in that, I've just been using <code>irb</code>.

Finally, I'll also be including any throwaway programs I try to write in Ruby until I am confident enough to move on.

<h3>Addendum</h4>

As this project is designed for me to experiment with programming, I'm going to use this README to list technologies I'd like to eventually incorporate into a project, as well as technologies and skills related to it I'd like to improve.  I'll also list resources I've found that might be useful (this is just a brain dump. I don't expect to learn nearly this many technologies or use all these resources, these are just the ones I have encountered and had some level of interest in throughout my experience):
