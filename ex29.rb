# sets variable people to 20
people = 20
# sets variable cats to 30
cats = 30
# sets variable dogs to 15
dogs = 15


# evaluates boolean condition
if people < cats
  # if statement true, prints string
  puts "Too many cats! The world is doomed!"
  # ends statement
end

# evaluates boolean condition
if people > cats
  # if condition true, prints string
  puts "Not many cats! The world is saved!"
  # ends the statement
end

# evaluates condition
if people < dogs
  # if condition is true, print the string
  puts "The world is drooled on!"
  # ends statement
end

# evaluates condition
if people > dogs
  # if true, prints the string
  puts "The world is dry!"
  # ends statement
end


# increments variable dogs by 5
dogs += 5

# evaluates condition
if people >= dogs
  # if true, print the string
  puts "People are greater than or equal to dogs."
  # ends statement
end

# evaluates condition
if people <= dogs
  # if true, print the string
  puts "People are less than or equal to dogs."
  # ends statement
end


# evaluates condition
if people == dogs
  # if true, prints the string
  puts "People are dogs."
  # ends statement
end

# The if statement asks Ruby to evaluate a condition
  # with a result of a boolean. If true, execute code in statement
  # if false, do not
# the code under it is indented because it is the function to execute
# if not indented, still works
# Yes
# The outputs change

# Zed's Answers
  # if statement creates a "branch," if true, go one way, if not, skip
  # identifies that it is a block of code
  # without end, errors occur
  # Yes
  # outputs change
